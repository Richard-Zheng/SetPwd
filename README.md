# SetPwd

A small app that uses the Device Admin API to set passwords.

## Introduction

In some cases, you can't set lockscreen password on your Android device. For example, when the device has its own security policies that prevent you from setting a password arbitrarily. This App wants to solve this problem by using the Device Admin API.

## Shortcoming

On Android 7 and higher version, password can't be set when there already exists one. So you must clean your lockscreen password before using this app.

## Features

- Set lockscreen password

- Set the maximum number of failed password before wiping data

- Erase all data (factory reset)
